### What is this made for?
- I wanted to control my Servos using an app and so I decided to make this app in WinForms using C# to connect with the bluetooth module (HC-05) and control the servos.

### Features
- You can enable automated servo movement that uses an algorithm (inside the arduino code), I use this for my cat to play with the laser
- You can enable or deactivate the laser through the app
- You can manually control the servo movement (Right, Left, Up, Down)

I am planning to add new functionalities to the app when I add more components with my servo (such as a camera) and switching to WiFi.
